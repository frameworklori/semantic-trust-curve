# Semantic Trust Curve (STC) — Overview
A language-based trust evaluation framework designed for next-generation ethical AI systems.

---

## 🌐 What Is the Semantic Trust Curve?
The **Semantic Trust Curve (STC)** is a privacy-preserving framework that measures user trust, credibility perception, and engagement *purely through semantics*—not through behavioral tracking.

STC does **not** collect:
- clicks  
- time-on-page  
- cursor movement  
- cookies  
- device identifiers  
- background telemetry  

Instead, trust is inferred from:
- how users respond  
- how they question  
- how they accept or reject sources  
- depth of follow-up questions  
- emotional tone or stability  
- semantic preference patterns

## 💡 Why STC Matters
Modern AI systems rely heavily on hidden engagement signals.  
STC offers a new foundation:

- Ethical by design  
- Privacy-preserving  
- Transparent  
- Based entirely on conversation  
- Not dependent on surveillance  

This positions STC as a future standard for safe AI trust analytics.
