# STC Star Rating Trust Model (Concept Layer)

The STC framework uses an optional five-star system to let users express their trust level quickly and intuitively.

---

## ⭐ What the Stars Represent
- ★★★★★ = Highly trustworthy, accurate, reliable  
- ★★★★☆ = Good quality, minor concerns  
- ★★★☆☆ = Neutral, unsure  
- ★★☆☆☆ = Weak credibility  
- ★☆☆☆☆ = Untrustworthy  

This is **semantic feedback**, not behavioral tracking.

---

## ⭐ When Stars Are Used
AI may ask:

> “You received three links.  
> Which one feels the most trustworthy?  
> Please rate each link from ★1 to ★5.”

The rating:
- is voluntary  
- carries no telemetry  
- is stored only in conversation context  
- supports trust-learning ethically  

---

## ⭐ Why Star Ratings Work
- Simple and intuitive  
- Zero privacy harm  
- No tracking needed  
- Produces high-quality trust signals  
- Enhances AI–user transparency  
- Enables semantic preference modeling (conceptual layer only)
