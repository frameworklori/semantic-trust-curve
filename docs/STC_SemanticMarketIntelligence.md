# Semantic Market Intelligence (SMI)  
A Privacy-Respecting Approach to Insight and Preference Analysis

---

## 🌐 What Is SMI?
Semantic Market Intelligence (SMI) is the STC method of analyzing:

- trust patterns  
- content preference  
- comparative credibility  
- emotional resonance  
- semantic stability  
- user-highlighted signals  

using only **language**, without collecting any behavior-based data.

---

## 💡 Why SMI Matters
Traditional market intelligence depends on:
- tracking pixels  
- engagement logs  
- third-party cookies  
- demographic profiling  
- cross-device identifiers  

SMI replaces all of that with:
- natural responses  
- star ratings  
- comparative judgments  
- trust reflection questions  
- semantic clustering (conceptual view only)  

---

## 📊 Applications (Concept Layer Only)
- evaluating trust in news sources  
- assessing which link users prefer  
- ranking content credibility  
- measuring sentiment × trust interaction  
- discovering emerging concerns  
- identifying shifts in user confidence  

---

## 🧭 How It Works (Public-Level View)
SMI reads signals like:
- “I trust link A more than B.”  
- “This feels biased.”  
- “This matches what I know.”  
- “★★☆☆☆ — not credible.”  

These **semantic expressions** form the basis of analysis.

No tracking.  
No profiling.  
No surveillance.
