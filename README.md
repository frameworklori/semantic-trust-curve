# Semantic Trust Curve (STC)

A privacy-safe framework for measuring user trust in AI systems through semantic dialogue instead of behavioral tracking.

The Semantic Trust Curve enables AI models to infer trust, credibility, and engagement signals **solely from language**—including dialogue patterns, user responses, and contextual feedback—**without clicks, cookies, logs, or surveillance**.  
This design establishes a new standard for ethical, transparent, next-generation AI interaction.

## 🌐 Core Concept

Traditional trust analytics rely on:
- Click-through rates  
- User behavior logs  
- Hidden tracking mechanisms  
- Engagement metrics tied to surveillance  

STC rejects these methods and instead adopts:

### **🟣 Semantic-First Trust Assessment**
Trust is measured from:
- How the user responds  
- How directly他 answers  
- Whether他提出反饋  
- 對話的韌性與持續性  
- Whether他主動 ask deeper questions  
- Whether他接受或質疑引用的來源  

All signals come from *language*, not behavior.

## 🛡 Privacy Philosophy  
STC follows a **Zero-Tracking Principle**:
- No telemetry  
- No user monitoring  
- No cookies  
- No clickstream capture  
- No behavioral fingerprints
