# Semantic Trust Curve (STC)

A privacy-safe framework for measuring user trust in AI systems through semantic dialogue instead of behavioral tracking.

The Semantic Trust Curve enables AI models to infer trust, credibility, and engagement signals **solely from language**—including dialogue patterns, user responses, and contextual feedback—**without clicks, cookies, logs, or surveillance**.  
This design establishes a new standard for ethical, transparent, next-generation AI interaction.

## 🌐 Core Concept

Traditional trust analytics rely on:
- Click-through rates  
- User behavior logs  
- Hidden tracking mechanisms  
- Engagement metrics tied to surveillance  

STC rejects these methods and instead adopts:

### **🟣 Semantic-First Trust Assessment**

Trust is measured from:

How the user responds
How directly they answer
Whether they offer feedback
The resilience and continuity of the dialogue
Whether they proactively ask deeper questions
Whether they accept or challenge cited sources

All signals come from language, not behavior.

## 🛡 Privacy Philosophy  
STC follows a **Zero-Tracking Principle**:
- No telemetry  
- No user monitoring  
- No cookies  
- No clickstream capture  
- No behavioral fingerprints
