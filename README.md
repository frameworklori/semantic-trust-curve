Semantic Trust Curve (STC)

A privacy-preserving framework for measuring user trust through language, not surveillance.

The Semantic Trust Curve evaluates trust, credibility, and engagement based entirely on dialogue semantics—not clicks, cookies, device fingerprints, or behavior tracking.
STC uses natural conversation, user responses, and contextual feedback to infer trust signals ethically and transparently.

This repository contains the public conceptual layer of STC.
All algorithms and scoring logic are maintained separately in a private core repository.

🌐 1. Core Concept

Traditional trust analytics depend on hidden data:
	•	click-through rates
	•	browsing logs
	•	engagement tracking
	•	behavioral fingerprints

STC rejects all surveillance-based metrics and introduces:

⭐ Semantic-First Trust Assessment

AI evaluates trust from:
	•	how users respond
	•	how they question sources
	•	whether they provide feedback
	•	depth, clarity, and continuation of dialogue
	•	acceptance vs. rejection of information
	•	emotional tone shifts

Everything comes from language alone.

⭐ 2. Star-Based Feedback System (★★★★★)

STC integrates an optional 5-star semantic rating module, allowing users to quickly express:
	•	perceived truthfulness
	•	trust in the source
	•	value of the information
	•	preference among multiple links
	•	content quality
	•	overall credibility

Example:

“Which of the three links did you find most accurate?
Rate each: ★1 to ★5.”

This enables AI to collect fully voluntary, privacy-safe evaluation data.

📊 3. Semantic Market Intelligence (SMI)

A major extension of STC is its ability to perform:

Semantic Market Research — without tracking users.

By analyzing:
	•	star ratings
	•	semantic feedback
	•	preferred links
	•	trust expressions
	•	rejection patterns
	•	curiosity spikes
	•	conversation depth

STC can generate powerful market insights:
	•	trust heatmaps
	•	source-credibility ranking
	•	brand or content preference analysis
	•	audience segmentation via semantic clustering
	•	sentiment-trust overlays

This makes STC suitable for:
	•	product research
	•	content testing
	•	news trustworthiness analysis
	•	consumer insight studies
	•	ethical AI analytics
	•	enterprise decision systems

🛡 4. Privacy Principles

STC follows Zero-Tracking and Zero-Telemetry rules:
	•	no cookies
	•	no clickstream
	•	no profiling
	•	no device IDs
	•	no behavior logs

All insights come only from what users voluntarily say.
